# Number Guesser

This GUI-based program allows a user to guess a randomly chosen number. After each guess, the user is told whether their guess if higher than, lower than, or equal to the chosen number. The user wins the round once
they have successfully guessed the chosen number. Once they have successfully guessed the number, they have the option to play again if they desire.

To run the program, clone this repository and make sure that you have Go (found [here](https://go.dev/dl/)) installed on your machine. Once Go is installed, run *go run .* in the parent directory to start the program. Once the program is running, navigate to *localhost:8080* in your web browser. You should now be able to see the home page of the Number Guesser!
